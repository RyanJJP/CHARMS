  """
  Loss function for multimodal contrastive learning based off of the CLIP paper.
  
  Embeddings are taken, L2 normalized and dot product between modalities is calculated to generate a cosine
  similarity between all combinations of subjects in a cross-modal fashion. Tempered by temperature.
  Loss is calculated attempting to match each subject's embeddings between the modalities i.e. the diagonal.
